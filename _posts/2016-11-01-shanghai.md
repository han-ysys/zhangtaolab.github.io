Information:
Genomics data is now widely used to understand the genetic basis of plant variation associated with crop yield increase. Massively parallel and single molecule sequencing technologies enable rapid acquisition of genomic data to enable deep, systematic mining of genetic diversity. Integration of genomics knowledge with genetic research techniques creates new strategies in plant biology. This conference will present recent genomic breakthroughs and explore key questions in crop productivity. It covers a broad range of genomic technologies currently used to dissect the functional mechanisms of crop production and sustainability. The new developments in agricultural genomics create new opportunities to investigate the genomic diversity of crops and germplasms, heterosis, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and determinants of quality, nutrition and yield, and to apply these findings to breeding better crops.
